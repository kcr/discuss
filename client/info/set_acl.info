NAME
     set_acl, sa - Set access to the current meeting by adding a principal
		   to the meeting's access control list (acl).
		   
SYNOPSYS
     set_acl [ modes | null ] principal 

DESCRIPTION
     set_acl sets the access given to the principal name given on the
     command line to the requested modes.  If the modes is "null", no
     access is allowed for that principal.  See access(discuss) for
     information on interpreting access modes.

     It is possible to enter principal names without a realm
     attached; these then default to the local realm.

DIAGNOSTICS
     No current meeting.
	The user is not attending a meeting.  The "goto" request allows
        the user to attend a meeting.

     Insufficient access for operation.
	Insufficient access to set the given access.  Set_acl
	requires chairman (c) access on the meeting.

     Chairman cannot remove his own access.
	A chairman cannot remove his chairman access to a meeting.  This
	prevents a situation where nobody has chairman access to the
	meeting.
