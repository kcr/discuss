REPLY(DISCUSS)					   REPLY(DISCUSS)

NAME
     reply, repl, rp - Enter a reply to an existing transaction
	(message) into a meeting.

SYNOPSIS
     reply transaction_specifier [-editor name] [-meeting name]
	[-no_editor] [-subject]

DESCRIPTION
     Reply allows one to enter a reply to an existing transaction.  If
     no transaction specifier is given, the transaction replied to is
     the current transaction (the last one printed).  Note that many
     modern discuss meetings are archives of mailing lists, and 
     replying within discuss will not reply to the mailing list.
     This means that readers of the mailing list who do not check
     the discuss meeting (probably most of them) will not receive
     a reply posted with this method.

     If the DISCUSS_EDITOR environment variable is set, then it will
     fork a subprocess to run the program named in the environment
     variable. When the editor is finished, it reads in the file and
     appends it to the meeting as a new transaction, setting the
     "pref" and "nref" link it to the transaction it is a reply to.
     By default, the subject field is set to be "Re: " prepended
     to the subject of the message being replied to.

     If the DISCUSS_EDITOR environment variable is not set, Discuss
     prompts for the transaction input directly.  When entering
     the transaction, typing "\f" or "~e" on a line by itself will
     fork a subprocess to run the editor specified by the EDITOR
     environment variable.  Typing "~v" on a line by itself will fork
     a subprocess to run the editor specified by the VISUAL environment
     variable.  When the editor is finished, Discuss reads the file and
     appends it to the meeting as a new transaction, setting the "pref"
     and "nref" links and the subject field as above.

OPTIONS
     -editor specifies another editor to use instead of the default.

     -meeting causes the reply to be entered into the named meeting, rather
	than the current one.

     -no_editor causes the transaction to be taken from standard input,
        with no editing allowed.

     -subject causes the user to be prompted for a new subject.  The
	transaction will still be chained to the original, but with a
	different subject.

FILES
     /tmp/mtg%d.%d     Temporary file for use with editor
