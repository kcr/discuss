NAME
     announce_meeting, ann_mtg, anm -
	Announce a meeting in another meeting

SYNOPSYS
     anm {-private | -public} mtg_to_announce mtg_to_announce_in

DESCRIPTION
     Announce_meeting puts a meeting announcement about a discuss
     meeting into another discuss meeting.  A meeting announcement
     is a specially formatted transaction that describes the meeting's
     location, and name. Other users can use this meeting announcement
     to add the meeting into the list of meetings using the 'add_meeting'
     request.

     Like 'talk', announce_meeting forks a subprocess to run your default
     editor (as specified by the EDITOR environment variable).  The
     newly created file is used as the text of the meeting announcement.

     The -private and -public flags control whether the meeting
     participation is listed as private or public.  This has no
     effect on the access control, but simply states whether
     the announcer considers the meeting to be public or private
     in nature.
