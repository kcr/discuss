NAME
     next_meeting, nm - Advanced to next changed meeting

SYNOPSIS
     nm [-ls]

DESCRIPTION
     Next_meeting advances to the next changed meeting listed in
     the previous invocation of check_meetings.  By repeatedly
     issuing next_meeting, a user can visit all changed discuss 
     meetings.

     Next_meeting is a variation of the 'goto' command, which automatically
     goes to the next changed meeting, as determined by 'check_meetings'.

OPTIONS
     -list (-ls)
	Don't visit the next meeting; instead, just list the meetings
      which you'll go through by repeated "nm"'s

SEE ALSO
     discuss(1),check_meetings(discuss),goto(discuss)

DIAGNOSTICS
     No more changed meetings
	The user has reached the end of the list of changed meetings.

     Insufficient access for operation
	The user does not have sufficient access to attend the given
	meeting.  Next_meeting requires either read (r) or status (s)
	access to attend a meeting.

     Use check_meetings first.
	You need to run the check_meetings command to initialize the
	list of changed meetings.
