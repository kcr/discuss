TOPIC
     access - access control for discuss

DESCRIPTION
     The discuss system permits fine-grained access control to meetings.
     Each meeting has an access control list (acl) which specifies
     who is allowed to manipulate the meeting.  The acl consists of a
     series of pairs consisting of a set of allowed access modes and a 
     (possibly wildcarded) Kerberos ID.

     When specified in the command line, principal names take the form 
     of a username followed by optional instance and realm names; if
     unspecified, the instance defaults to the null instance, and the realm
     defaults to the local realm.  The instance is separated from the 
     username by a '.' character; the realm is separated by a '@' 
     character.

     There are seven possible permitted access modes:

	a (Answer):
	   Indicates that the principal can respond to transactions in
	   the meeting.

	c (Chairman):
	   Indicates that the principal is a chairman, allowing him to 
	   edit the access control list.  Note that a chairman who does not
	   watch what he is doing can delete his own access from the
	   meeting.  Also, having chairman access does not
	   automatically imply any other form of access

	d (Delete):
	   Indicates that the principal may delete or retrieve from deletion
	   any transaction in the meeting.

	o (Owner):
	   Indicates that the principal may delete or retrieve from deletion
	   any transaction entered by that principal.

	r (Read):
	   Indicates that the principal may read or list any
	   transaction in the meeting.

	s (Status): 
	   Indicates that the principal may find out summary information 
	   about a meeting, such as listing the access control list,
	   finding the number of transactions, etc.

	w (Write):
	   Indicates that the user may add a new transaction to the meeting
	   as other than a reply.

     Normal access configurations:
     There are a few normal access configurations for discuss, depending on 
     the purpose of the meeting.  Using access control lists, it is possible
     to fine-tune who is permitted to access a meeting.

     There should always be one or more chairmen for a meeting; the chairmen 
     should have full ("acdorsw") access.  If the meeting is "public" and 
     for general discussion on some topic, the only other entry on the ACL
     should be "aorsw" for "*".  

     If a meeting is for "official" announcements from a limited
     number of principals, they should be given "aorsw" access, 
     while access for "*" should be set to "ors".

     If a meeting is designed for bug reporting, where everyone can make
     reports, but only designated people may make official responses,
     access should be set to "orsw" for "*" and "aorsw" for the designated 
     respondants.

     Meetings designed as archives for mailing lists should have a chairman,
     have "w" access for "daemon@<local-realm>", and "ors" access for "*".
     See the man page for dsmail(1) to see how that should be set up.

BUGS
     Currently, the only allowed wildcard is "*", indicating all
     possible principals.
