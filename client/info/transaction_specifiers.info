TOPIC
     specifiers - transaction specifiers for discuss

DESCRIPTION
     Many discuss commands, such as "list", operate on a set of
     transactions; as such, they take transaction specifiers
     as command line arguments.

     The following transaction specifiers specify a set of
     transactions: 

	all:  Matches all transactions in the current meeting.
	new:  Matches all unseen transactions.
	aref: Matches all transactions in the current chain.

     The remaining transaction specifiers specify a single
     transaction.  By using a pair of them separated by a comma or
     colon ("," or ":"), it is possible to specify a range of 
     transactions; also, it is possible to specify simple arithmetic 
     expressions by separating two specifiers with a "+" or "-" sign.
  
	current, .: Matches the current transaction.
	first, f:  Matches the first transaction of the meeting.
	last, l: Matches the last transaction of the meeting.
	prev, p: Matches the previous transaction in the meeting.
	next, n: Matches the next transaction in the meeting.
	fref: Matches the first transaction in the current chain.
	lref: Matches the last transaction in the current chain.
	nref: Matches the next transaction in the current chain.
	pref: Matches the previous transaction in the current chain.
        Any integer matches the transaction of the same number.
