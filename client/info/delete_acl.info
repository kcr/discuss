DELETE_ACL(DISCUSS)			      DELETE_ACL(DISCUSS)

NAME
     delete_acl, da - Delete entries from the current meeting's
		      access control list.

SYNOPSIS
     delete_acl principal ...

DESCRIPTION
     delete_acl deletes the principal names given on the command line
     from the access control list (acl) of the meeting; their access is
     now equivalent to access for "*".   If * does not have an entry on
     the acl, then only principals listed in the acl have access to the
     meeting.
     
     If you want to explicitly prevent someone from attending a meeting,
     use "sa null [principal]".

     It is possible to enter principal names without a realm
     attached; these then default to the local realm.

DIAGNOSTICS
     No current meeting.
	The user is not attending a meeting.  The "goto" request allows
        the user to attend a meeting.

     Insufficient access for operation.
	Insufficient access to delete the given access.  Delete_acl
	requires chairman (c) access on the meeting.

     Chairman cannot remove his own access.
	A chairman cannot remove his own access to a meeting.  This
	prevents a situation where nobody has chairman access to the
	meeting.

     Principal not on ACL
        The given principal was not on the access control list.
