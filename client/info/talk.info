TALK(DISCUSS)					    TALK(DISCUSS)

NAME
     talk, enter, send, t - Enter a new transaction (message) into a
     meeting.

SYNOPSYS
     talk

DESCRIPTION
     Talk, enter, and send are all aliases for the same function of
     discuss, which enters a transaction into the current meeting.

     Talk first prompts for the subject of the transaction, which is 
     one line of text.  If the DISCUSS_EDITOR environment variable
     is set, then it will fork a subprocess to run the program
     named in the environment variable. When the editor is finished,
     it reads in the file and appends it to the meeting as
     a new transaction.

     If the DISCUSS_EDITOR environment variable is not set, Discuss
     prompts for the transaction input directly.  When entering
     the transaction, typing "\f" or "~e" on a line by itself will
     fork a subprocess to run the editor specified by the EDITOR
     environment variable.  Typing "~v" on a line by itself will fork
     a subprocess to run the editor specified by the VISUAL environment
     variable.  When the editor is finished, Discuss reads the file and
     appends it to the meeting as a new transaction.

OPTIONS
     -editor (-ed)
	specifies another editor to use instead of the default.

     -meeting (-mtg) meeting_name
	causes the reply to be entered into the named meeting, rather
	than the current one.

     -no_editor (-ned)
	causes talk to use Fend as the "editor," even if the 
	DISCUSS_EDITOR environment variable is set.


FILES
     /tmp/mtg%d.%d     Temporary file for use with editor

SEE ALSO
     environ(7), discuss(1), reply(discuss)

DIAGNOSTICS
     No file; not entered
	The file containing the new transaction was not found; it
	apparantly was not created by the editor.  

     No current meeting.
	The user is not attending a meeting.  The "goto" request allows
        the user to attend a meeting.

     You do not have access to create transactions in this meeting.
	Talk requires write (w) access on the meeting.  Most meetings which
	are read-only are fed through mail aliases; read the chairman's note
	[0001] for information.

     Error reading subject
	An error was encountered while reading the subject (probably
	end of file)

     Transaction [####] entered in the xxxx meeting.
	The transaction was successfully entered into the current
	meeting.

     Entry will be anonymous
	If you have not been able to authenticate yourself to the server
	using Kerberos, your message will be entered anonymously (from ???).
