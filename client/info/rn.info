NAME
     read_new, rn - Print new transactions in all changed meetings.

SYNOPSIS
     rn

DESCRIPTION
     rn combines the functionality of the check_meetings, next_meeting
     and print requests to provide a simple interface for users who
     want to see all new transactions in changed meetings.
     
SEE ALSO
     discuss(1),check_meetings(discuss), next_meeting(discuss), print(discuss)

DIAGNOSTICS
     No meetings have changed
	No meetings that the user attends have new transactions.

     Can't read Kerberos ticket file while connecting to ...
	Unable to obtain kerberos tickets for the given machine.
	The user will not be authenticated to meetings on that given
	machine.  There are several different possible reasons why
	this is happening.  The user may not have gotten kerberos
        tickets, or the kerberos servers may be down, or there might
	be time disagreement between the client machine and the servers.

BUGS
     Sometimes gets out of sync between 'rn' prompts and 'more' prompts,
     which results in strange behavior.  This will be fixed when more is
     built-in to discuss, instead of using the standard version.
